            <p>I am Computer Engineering student at Iowa State
                University. This semester I am taking User Interfaces, Algorithms, Database Mangement Systems, and
                Operating Systems. I play Ulimate Frisbee in my free time.</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Quoridor</h3>
                <p>The goal of the project was to develop a digital version of the board game Quoridor. I actively
                    worked with a group of developers, mostly focusing on backend coding to ensure fluid gameplay and
                    precise game mechanics. Git's version control system enabled us to work quickly and successfully
                    integrate our code.<br><br>

                    My cooperation, communication, and coordination skills were considerably improved as a result of
                    working on this project in a group. It emphasized how crucial good communication is to getting a
                    shared objective. A valuable skill I developed was using MySQL for effective database management,
                    which allowed me to permanently store game data and player profiles.<br><br>

                    This project's usefulness goes beyond the classroom. Quoridor's appeal to a wider audience can be
                    improved by making the game available online. Its potential use is in giving players an online
                    setting in which to play strategically, encouraging analytical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
